# Web Demestified

## What is "The Web" and how does it work?  
> The `Web`  

1. Documents are available on servers. The web is a collection of documents that will be requested by a browser from a server.  

2. Documents are accessible through a web address.  

3. The browser will mix all the necessary documents to turn any `HTML` document into a nice web page.

## What's HTML and how does it work?  
> `HTML`

`HTML` is a descriptive language that allows us to tell a web browser how to handle text content.  
`HTML` is an acronym standing for HyperText Markup Language.  

`HTML` follow rules defined by the **HTML Specification**, which is maintain by the **World Wide Web Consortium**, a.k.a W3C.  

1. `HTML` is a markup language that allows to structure a text in order to make it understandable by web browsers.   

2. `HTML` is made of elements formed by tags.  

3. `HTML` is maintained by the W3C. All valid `HTML` elements and their nesting rules are defined in a specification mantained  by the W3C.  


## What is CSS and how does it style web pages?  
> `CSS` 

LIke `HTML`, `CSS` is a declarative language, but instead of defining a semantic for some text, it defines the look and feel of each `HTML` elements.  
`CSS` is an acronym standing for Cascading Style Sheets.  

1. CSS is a declarative langugage that allows you to define the look and feel of HTML elements.  

2. Style rules target HTML elements with selectors and they applied visual effects defined by style declarations.  

3. The cascade defines how to mix style rules. The cascade allows to override and combine those rules. 


## What's JavaScript and how does it work?  
> `JavaScript` 

`JavaScript` is the programming language at the heart of the modern web.  

`JavaScript` has been standardized at the standrds organization ECMA international under the name **ECMAScript**.    

**ECMAScript** defines the basic syntax of the language and its core mechanisms.  But in itself it doesn't do very much.  
Like any other programming language, it needs a standard library to be truly usable, and this is where things get complicated.    

These days there are two flavors of `JavaScript`:   
* JavaScript in the browser: 
    * Modify your HTML document (DOM)  
    * Making network requests (Fetch XMLHttpRequest)  
    * Managing data (Web Storage IndexedDB)  
    * Doing audio and graphics redering (Web Audio / WebGL / Canvas 2D)  
    * (WebVTT)  
    * (Web Notifications)  
    * (WebRTC)  
    * (Web Animations)  
    * (WebVR)  
    * (Encrypted Media Extensions)  
    * (Push)  
    * (Pointer Events)  
    * (Web Workers)  
    * (Web Components)  
    * (Geolocation)  
    * (Service Workers)  
    * (Fullscreen)  
    * (Drag and Drop)  
    * (XMLHttpRequest)  
    * (Touch Events)  
    * (Websockets)  
    * (Performance)  
    * (Intersection Observer)  
    * (Web Crypto)  
    * (Page Visibility)  
    * (Web Authentication)  
* JavaScript in the server:  (node.js)
    * Manage the computer directly (Path OS)  
    * Access files and folders (File System)  
    * Handle network resources (Net / URL / HTTP/2)  
    * spawn processes (Process / Child Processes) 
    * (Performance Hooks)  
    * (Internationalization)  
    * (Async Hooks)  
    * (Timers)  
    * (Domain)  
    * (DNS)  
    * (Events)  
    * (Cluster)  
    * (TLS/SSL)  
    * (Readling)  
    * (Stream)  
    * (Assertion Testing)  
    * (Srypto)  
    * (Buffer)  
    * (Inspector)  
    * (Debugger)  
    * (Errors)  
    * (Console)  

1. `JavaScript` is a programming language.  

2. It's a combination of the `ECMAScript` standard with other standard functionalities. It is made of `ECMAScript` plus some standard APIs.  

3. It's highly asynchronous and it can react to events.  


## What are Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) & how are they special?  
> Scalable Vector Graphics (`SVG`) 

`SVG` is a acronym standing for Scalable Vector Graphics, and **it's the only vector image format for the web.**

Two flavors: **Bitmap** and **Vector**.  
* Bitmap for web: `JEPG` / `PNG` / `GIF`  
* Vector for web: `SVG`  

**Drawing SVG software:**  
* Inskape  
* Illustrator  
* Sketch  

**JavaScirpt libraries**:  
* snap.svg  
* Bonsai  
* D3.js

1. `SVG` is a vector image format, and it's perfect for creating images that stay sharp at any scale.  

2. It can be authored, styled and scripted like HTML would be.  

3. It's easier to use a drawing tool to create an `SVG` image.  

## How do web browsers work?  
> How browsers work?  

1. Browsers hadle network, content display, data storage, and content security.  

2. Their technical requirements are the same as those of AAA games.  

3. They let web creators building any type of content.(Any form of interactivity)
